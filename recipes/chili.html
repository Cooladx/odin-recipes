    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <h4>Step 1</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/ingredients.jpg" />
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <h4>Step 2</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/pepper.jpg" />
      <img src="../images/chili/pepper2.jpg" />

      <li>
        Place peppers in a large skillet and heat over medium-low heat; cook,
        turning once, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per
        side. Transfer chiles to a bowl and cover with hot water; let stand for
        30 minutes.
      </li>
      <h4>Step 3</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/pepper3.jpg" />

      <li>
        Drain chiles, reserving about 1/2 cup of the soaking water. Use a paring
        knife to slice open each pepper, and remove and discard stems and seeds
        by running under a gentle stream of tap water.
      </li>
      <h4>Step 4</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/4.jpg" />

      <li>
        Combine chiles, chipotle pepper, and reserved 1/2 cup water in a
        blender; blend until a smooth paste forms, 15 to 30 seconds. Set aside.
      </li>
      <h4>Step 5</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/5.jpg" />

      <li>
        Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes in a
        large bowl with salt and pepper until evenly coated. Add half of the
        beef to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally to brown most
        sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with
        remaining beef.
      </li>
      <h4>Step 6</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/6.jpg" />

      <li>
        Add onions and garlic to drippings in Dutch oven and cook, stirring
        constantly, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cumin and
        cinnamon, and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and fragrant,
        about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <h4>Step 7</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/7.jpg" />

      <li>
        Add blended chili paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <h4>Step 8</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/8.jpg" />

      <li>
        Add 1/4 cup of the water and masa harina, whisking until incorporated to
        avoid lumps. Add stock and remaining 1 1/4 cups water and stir to
        combine.
      </li>
      <h4>Step 9</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/9.jpg" />
      <img src="../images/chili/10.jpg" />

      <li>
        Add bay leaves and reserved beef and bring to a simmer over medium-high.
        Reduce heat to maintain a very low simmer and cook, partially covered,
        stirring occasionally, until liquid is thickened, about 2 hours. Stir in
        brown sugar and vinegar.
      </li>
      <h4>Step 10</h4>
      <img src="../images/chili/11.jpg" />

      <li>
        Remove from heat and let stand for 20 minutes before serving warm with
        sour cream and lime wedges.
      </li>
    </ol>
